# Style Guide for Java

The following guidelines should be followed when writing Java code for this project.

## Naming Conventions

- **Class Names**: Class names should be written in UpperCamelCase. For example: `MyClass`.
- **Method Names**: Method names should be written in lowerCamelCase. For example: `myMethod`.
- **Variable Names**: Variable names should also be written in lowerCamelCase. For example: `myVariable`.
- **Constant Names**: Constant names should be written in all caps with underscores separating words. For example: `MY_CONSTANT`.

## Formatting

- **Indentation**: Use 4 spaces for indentation. Do not use tabs.
- **Braces**: Opening braces should be on the same line as the statement that begins the block. Closing braces should be on a new line.
- **Line Length**: Each line of code should be no longer than 80 characters.
- **Spacing**: There should be a space after keywords (`if`, `for`, `while`, etc.) and between operators (`+`, `-`, `=`, etc.).

## Comments

- **Class Comments**: Every class should have a comment that describes what the class does.
- **Method Comments**: Every method should have a comment that describes what the method does, its parameters, and its return value (if any).
- **In-line Comments**: In-line comments should be used sparingly and only to clarify complex code.

## Other Guidelines

- **Use Standard Libraries**: Whenever possible, use standard libraries instead of writing your own code.
- **Avoid Magic Numbers**: Do not use "magic numbers" (hard-coded numerical values) in your code. Instead, define constants for these values.
- **Error Handling**: Handle errors and exceptions appropriately. Do not ignore or suppress them.

## Example

Here is an example of Java code that follows these guidelines:

```Java

public class MyClass {
/**
* This method does something.
*
* @param param1 The first parameter.
* @param param2 The second parameter.
* @return The result of the operation.
*/
public int myMethod(int param1, int param2) {
  int result = param1 + param2;
    if (result > 10) {
      result = 10;
    }
  return result;
  }
}

```


These guidelines should be followed as closely as possible to ensure consistency throughout the codebase.
